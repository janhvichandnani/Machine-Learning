# Breast Cancer Classification

## Overview

This project applies machine learning techniques to classify breast cancer cases as malignant or benign. It utilizes a dataset from Scikit-Learn to train and evaluate predictive models.

## Dataset

The dataset is sourced from Scikit-Learn's built-in breast cancer dataset. It includes features extracted from digitized images of breast masses, describing characteristics of cell nuclei.

## Models

- Logistic Regression
- Other classification models (optional for comparison)

## Results

The best model achieved:

- Accuracy: 92**%**

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook to train and evaluate the model:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook notebooks/Breast_Cancer_Classification.ipynb
   ```
