# Diabetes Prediction using SVM

## Overview

This project applies Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification to predict diabetes based on patient health data. The dataset used is the PIMA Diabetes dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset contains medical records of patients, including features such as glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, and insulin levels, which are used to predict whether a patient has diabetes.

## Models

- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Results

The model achieved:

- Accuracy: **XX%**

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook to train and evaluate the model:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook notebooks/Diabetes_Prediction_SVM.ipynb
   ```
